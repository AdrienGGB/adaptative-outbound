  'sql-test-workspace-' || extract(epoch from now())::text,
  'eb2ffd42-eb22-4406-a398-be69eeca9ec5'::uuid
) as new_workspace_id;
```

**Result:**
- New workspace ID: `b13203cd-df6e-4021-9f75-226c7b5a2f8c`
- Workspace created: ✅
- Membership created: ✅
- Role assigned: `admin`
- Status: `active`

### Test 1.6: Verify Triggers ✅ PASSED

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation, event_object_table, action_statement
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE event_object_schema = 'auth' AND event_object_table = 'users';
```

**Result:**
Two triggers found on `auth.users`:
1. `on_auth_user_created` → `handle_new_user()` (creates profile)
2. `on_auth_user_create_default_workspace` → `create_default_workspace_for_user()`

**Function Implementation:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.create_default_workspace_for_user()
RETURNS trigger
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $function$
DECLARE
  default_workspace_id UUID;
  workspace_slug TEXT;
BEGIN
  -- Generate slug from email
  workspace_slug := LOWER(REGEXP_REPLACE(split_part(NEW.email, '@', 1), '[^a-z0-9]+', '-', 'g'))
                    || '-workspace-' || SUBSTRING(NEW.id::text FROM 1 FOR 8);

  -- Create workspace using helper function
  default_workspace_id := create_workspace_with_owner(
    split_part(NEW.email, '@', 1) || '''s Workspace',
    workspace_slug,
    NEW.id
  );

  RETURN NEW;
END;
$function$
```

**Status:** ✅ Both triggers properly configured

---

### Test 1.7: RLS Policies Verification ✅ PASSED

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual, with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'workspaces'
ORDER BY policyname;
```

**Result:**
Three RLS policies on `workspaces` table:

1. **Authenticated users can create workspaces** (INSERT)
   - Check: `auth.uid() = owner_id`
   - Ensures only the owner can create workspace for themselves

2. **Users can view workspaces they are members of** (SELECT)
   - Qual: User must have active membership in workspace
   - Properly restricts viewing to member workspaces only

3. **Workspace owners can update their workspace** (UPDATE)
   - Qual: `auth.uid() = owner_id`
   - Only owners can modify workspace settings

**Status:** ✅ RLS policies correctly configured

---

### Test 1.8: Database Consistency Check ✅ PASSED

**Metrics:**
- Total users: 1
- Total workspaces: 3
- Total memberships: 3
- All workspaces have members: ✅ TRUE

**Orphaned Data Check:**
```sql
-- Orphaned workspaces (should be 0)
SELECT w.* FROM workspaces w
LEFT JOIN workspace_members wm ON w.id = wm.workspace_id
WHERE wm.id IS NULL;
```
Result: 0 rows ✅

```sql
-- Users without workspaces (should be 0)
SELECT u.id, u.email FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN workspace_members wm ON u.id = wm.user_id
WHERE wm.id IS NULL;
```
Result: 0 rows ✅

**Status:** ✅ Database is consistent, no orphaned data

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT create_workspace_with_owner(
  'Performance Test Workspace',
  'perf-test-' || extract(epoch from now())::text,
  'eb2ffd42-eb22-4406-a398-be69eeca9ec5'::uuid
);
```

**Result:**
- Planning Time: 0.116 ms

## Part 5: Performance Metrics

### Workspace Creation Performance ✅ EXCELLENT

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Planning Time | 0.116 ms | < 10 ms | ✅ Pass |
| Execution Time | 4.650 ms | < 100 ms | ✅ Pass |
| Total Time | ~4.77 ms | < 100 ms | ✅ Pass |

**Performance Rating:** ⚡ EXCELLENT

## Part 10: SQL Test Scripts

### Quick Database Health Check

```sql
-- Run this to verify everything is working
SELECT
  'Users' as entity, COUNT(*)::text as count FROM auth.users
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Workspaces', COUNT(*)::text FROM workspaces
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Memberships', COUNT(*)::text FROM workspace_members
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Orphaned Workspaces', COUNT(*)::text FROM workspaces w
  LEFT JOIN workspace_members wm ON w.id = wm.workspace_id
  WHERE wm.id IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Users Without Workspace', COUNT(*)::text FROM auth.users u
  LEFT JOIN workspace_members wm ON u.id = wm.user_id
  WHERE wm.id IS NULL;
```

### Test Workspace Creation

```sql
-- Get your user ID first
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users LIMIT 1;

-- Create a test workspace
SELECT create_workspace_with_owner(
  'Test Workspace ' || now()::text,
  'test-ws-' || extract(epoch from now())::text,
  'YOUR-USER-ID-HERE'::uuid
) as new_workspace_id;

-- Verify it was created
SELECT w.*, wm.role, wm.status
FROM workspaces w
JOIN workspace_members wm ON w.id = wm.workspace_id
WHERE w.name LIKE 'Test Workspace%'
ORDER BY w.created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### Cleanup Test Data

```sql
-- WARNING: Only run this to clean up test workspaces
-- DO NOT run on production data

-- Delete test workspaces (adjust WHERE clause as needed)
DELETE FROM workspace_members
WHERE workspace_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM workspaces WHERE name LIKE 'Test%' OR name LIKE 'SQL Test%'
);

DELETE FROM workspaces
WHERE name LIKE 'Test%' OR name LIKE 'SQL Test%';
```
