# BUG001: Apollo API Key Cannot Be Saved

**Status**: Fixed
**Date Reported**: 2025-10-20
**Date Fixed**: 2025-10-20
**Severity**: High (Blocks core feature F044)
**Reporter**: User
**Fixed By**: Claude Code

## Issue Description

Users were unable to save their Apollo API keys in the workspace settings page. When clicking "Save API Key", the operation would fail silently or with a database error.

## User Report

> "Could not save the Apollo API key"

## Root Cause Analysis

### Technical Explanation

The issue was caused by an **incomplete Row Level Security (RLS) policy** on the `workspace_settings` table.

In PostgreSQL, when you create an RLS policy using `FOR ALL` (which covers SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), you need to specify **both**:

1. **USING clause** - Controls which existing rows can be accessed/modified
2. **WITH CHECK clause** - Controls what new/updated row values are allowed

The original policy only had a `USING` clause:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Workspace admins can manage settings"
  ON workspace_settings FOR ALL
  USING (
    workspace_id IN (
      SELECT workspace_id FROM workspace_members
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      AND role IN ('owner', 'admin')
    )
  );
  -- MISSING: WITH CHECK clause!
```

### Why This Failed

Without a `WITH CHECK` clause, PostgreSQL would:
- Allow SELECT operations (read-only)
- Allow INSERT operations (for new rows)
- **REJECT UPDATE operations** (because there's no validation for the new row state)

Since saving an API key requires updating the `workspace_settings.apollo_api_key_encrypted` field, the UPDATE operation was being rejected by RLS.

### Error Behavior

The error would have appeared as:
- HTTP 500 Internal Server Error from the API route
- Database error in server logs: "new row violates row-level security policy"
- No visible feedback to the user (only "Failed to save API key" message)

## Files Affected

### Database Schema
- **File**: `/supabase/migrations/20251019160926_f044_data_pipeline.sql`
- **Lines**: 39-47 (RLS policy definition)

### Frontend
- **File**: `/web-app/src/app/workspace/settings/api/page.tsx`
- **Function**: `handleSaveApiKey()` (lines 60-92)
- **Note**: Frontend code was correct; the issue was purely backend/database

### API Route
- **File**: `/web-app/src/app/api/workspace/settings/apollo-key/route.ts`
- **Function**: `POST()` (lines 11-79)
- **Note**: API route was correct; it was being blocked by RLS

## The Fix

### Migration Created

**File**: `/supabase/migrations/20251020000002_fix_workspace_settings_rls_update.sql`

```sql
-- Drop the problematic policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Workspace admins can manage settings" ON workspace_settings;

-- Recreate with proper USING and WITH CHECK clauses
CREATE POLICY "Workspace admins can manage settings"
  ON workspace_settings FOR ALL
  USING (
    workspace_id IN (
      SELECT workspace_id FROM workspace_members
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      AND role IN ('owner', 'admin')
    )
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    workspace_id IN (
      SELECT workspace_id FROM workspace_members
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      AND role IN ('owner', 'admin')
    )
  );
```

### Original Migration Updated

Also updated the original migration file to include the fix from the start, preventing this issue in future database resets.

## Testing Steps

To verify the fix works:

1. **Start the local development server**:
   ```bash
   cd web-app
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Login as a workspace owner or admin**

3. **Navigate to**: http://localhost:3000/workspace/settings/api

4. **Enter a test Apollo API key**:
   - Use any string (e.g., `test-key-12345`)

5. **Click "Save API Key"**

6. **Expected Results**:
   - Success message appears: "API key saved successfully"
   - Badge changes to "Configured"
   - "Test Connection" and "Remove Key" buttons become enabled
   - Input field clears

7. **Verify in database** (optional):
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project
   supabase db reset  # Apply all migrations including fix
   ```

## Verification Query

To check if the RLS policy is correct:

```sql
SELECT
  policyname,
  cmd,
  qual IS NOT NULL as has_using,
  with_check IS NOT NULL as has_with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'workspace_settings'
ORDER BY policyname;
```

Expected output:
| policyname | cmd | has_using | has_with_check |
|------------|-----|-----------|----------------|
| Workspace admins can manage settings | ALL | true | **true** |
| Users can view settings in their workspace | SELECT | true | false |

## Impact

### Before Fix
- Users could NOT save Apollo API keys
- Feature F044 (Data Pipeline with Apollo enrichment) was completely blocked
- No way to configure third-party API integrations

### After Fix
- Users can successfully save, test, and remove Apollo API keys
- Auto-enrichment can be enabled
- Feature F044 is fully functional

## Lessons Learned

### RLS Policy Best Practices

1. **Always use WITH CHECK for FOR ALL policies**:
   ```sql
   FOR ALL USING (...) WITH CHECK (...)
   ```

2. **Or use specific commands**:
   ```sql
   FOR SELECT USING (...)
   FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (...)
   FOR UPDATE USING (...) WITH CHECK (...)
   FOR DELETE USING (...)
   ```

3. **Test all CRUD operations** when creating RLS policies:
   - SELECT (read)
   - INSERT (create)
   - UPDATE (modify)
   - DELETE (remove)

4. **Add WITH CHECK validation** to prevent data integrity issues

### Testing Checklist for RLS Policies

- [ ] Can users read data? (SELECT)
- [ ] Can users create new records? (INSERT)
- [ ] Can users update existing records? (UPDATE)
- [ ] Can users delete records? (DELETE)
- [ ] Are unauthorized users blocked?
- [ ] Do error messages make sense?

  -d '{"api_key": "test-key-12345", "workspace_id": "YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID"}'
```

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Code Review Checklist**:
   - All RLS policies have WITH CHECK when using FOR ALL
   - Test UPDATE operations specifically
   - Verify error messages are user-friendly

2. **Automated Testing**:
   - Add integration tests for RLS policies
   - Test all CRUD operations
   - Test with different user roles (owner, admin, member)

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document RLS patterns in project wiki
   - Create RLS policy templates
   - Share this bug report with team
