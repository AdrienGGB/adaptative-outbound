# Deployment Strategy

**Project:** Adaptive Outbound
**Date:** October 4, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Implementation

---

## 🎯 Overview

This deployment strategy outlines the phased rollout of all 12 features across **24 weeks** (6 months), balancing speed with stability, and ensuring each phase delivers user value.

### Key Principles

1. **Foundation First** - Build core infrastructure before advanced features
2. **Iterative Delivery** - Ship working features early, get feedback
3. **Risk Mitigation** - Test thoroughly before production
4. **User Value** - Each phase should unlock real functionality
5. **Zero Downtime** - Use feature flags and gradual rollouts

| **Staging** | QA & Testing | Supabase Staging | Vercel Preview | Staging Edge Functions |
| **Production** | Live users | Supabase Production | Vercel Production | Production Edge Functions |

### **Database Migration Strategy**

**Tools:**
- Supabase CLI for migration management
- Versioned migration files (001_auth.sql, 002_core_schema.sql, etc.)

**Process:**
```bash
# 1. Create migration
supabase migration new feature_name

# 2. Test in dev
supabase db reset --local

# 3. Apply to staging
supabase db push --db-url $STAGING_DB_URL

# 4. Apply to production (during maintenance window)
supabase db push --db-url $PRODUCTION_DB_URL
```

**Rollback Plan:**
- Keep last 3 migration versions ready to restore
- Test rollback scripts in staging before production
- For critical tables, create backups before migration

### **Deployment Pipeline**

**Web App (Next.js on Vercel):**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
on:
  push:
    branches: [dev, main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - Checkout code
      - Run tests
      - Deploy to Vercel (preview for dev, production for main)
      - Run smoke tests
      - Notify team in Slack
```

**Background Workers:**
- Deploy as Supabase Edge Functions or separate Node.js service
- Use Docker containers for consistency
- Auto-scaling based on job queue depth

### **Monitoring & Alerts**

**Key Metrics:**
- API response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Database query performance
- Job queue depth and processing time
- Error rates
- User session length

**Tools:**

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### **High-Risk Areas**

1. **Sequence Executor (F023)**
   - Risk: Email sending at scale could fail or damage sender reputation
   - Mitigation: Start with low limits, gradual ramp-up, monitoring

2. **Data Import (F001)**
   - Risk: Large CSV imports could timeout or corrupt data
   - Mitigation: Process in background jobs, validate thoroughly, rollback capability

3. **Email Integration (F020)**
   - Risk: OAuth flows could break, tracking could fail
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing with multiple providers, fallback mechanisms

4. **Third-party APIs**
   - Risk: Clearbit, OpenAI rate limits or outages
   - Mitigation: Implement caching, retry logic, graceful degradation

### **Rollback Procedures**

**Immediate Rollback (< 15 min):**
1. Revert to previous Vercel deployment (one-click)
2. Disable feature flag for problematic feature
3. Announce incident to users

**Database Rollback (< 1 hour):**
