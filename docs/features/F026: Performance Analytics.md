## üë• User Stories

### Performance Dashboard

1. **As an SDR**, I want to see my performance metrics so I know how I'm doing
2. **As a manager**, I want team-wide analytics so I can track overall progress
3. **As a user**, I want real-time updates so data is always current
4. **As an exec**, I want high-level KPIs so I can report to leadership

### Funnel Analytics

1. **As a manager**, I want to see conversion funnel so I identify drop-off points
2. **As an SDR**, I want to know my email ‚Üí reply ‚Üí meeting conversion so I optimize
3. **As a user**, I want to compare time periods so I track improvement
4. **As a manager**, I want to segment by sequence so I know what works

### Rep Performance

1. **As a manager**, I want rep leaderboard so I can recognize top performers
2. **As an SDR**, I want to see my rank so I know where I stand
3. **As a manager**, I want coaching insights so I help struggling reps
4. **As a user**, I want activity vs results view so I balance quality and quantity

### Reporting

1. **As a manager**, I want to export reports so I can share with leadership
2. **As a user**, I want scheduled reports via email so I get regular updates
3. **As an exec**, I want executive summary so I get the highlights
4. **As a user**, I want custom dashboards so I track what matters to me

## üîê Analytics Processing

### Data Refresh Strategy

```typescript
// Incremental updates for recent data
async function refreshRecentAnalytics() {
  const cutoffTime = new Date(Date.now() - 5 * 60 * 1000) // Last 5 minutes

  // Update daily summary for today
  await updateDailySummary(new Date())

  // Invalidate cached metrics
  await redis.del('analytics:dashboard:*')
}

// Scheduled job (every 5 minutes)
setInterval(refreshRecentAnalytics, 5 * 60 * 1000)

// Full refresh (nightly)
async function fullRefresh() {
  await supabase.rpc('refresh_daily_summary')
  await supabase.rpc('refresh_sequence_summary')
  await supabase.rpc('refresh_leaderboard')
}

// Schedule at 1 AM daily
cron.schedule('0 1 * * *', fullRefresh)
```

### Caching Strategy

```typescript
// Cache dashboard data for 5 minutes
async function getDashboardData(workspaceId: string, filters: any) {
  const cacheKey = `analytics:dashboard:${workspaceId}:${JSON.stringify(filters)}`

  // Try cache first
  const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey)
  if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached)

  // Query database
  const data = await queryDashboard(workspaceId, filters)

  // Cache for 5 minutes
  await redis.setex(cacheKey, 300, JSON.stringify(data))

  return data
}
```
