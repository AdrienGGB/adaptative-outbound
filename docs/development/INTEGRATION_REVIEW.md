**Status:** ✅ All features aligned and integrated

---

## ✅ Global Guidelines Alignment

### Tech Stack Consistency

All features correctly use:
- ✅ **Supabase** for database, auth, storage
- ✅ **Next.js 14+ App Router** for web app
- ✅ **React Native + Expo** for mobile app
- ✅ **TypeScript** throughout
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui** for web UI
- ✅ **Zod** for validation
- ✅ **@tanstack/react-query** for data fetching

### Database Architecture

All features:

- ✅ Include **RLS policies** for security
- ✅ Reference `workspaces` for multi-tenancy
- ✅ Use UUID primary keys
- ✅ Include proper indexes
- ✅ Have audit timestamps (created_at, updated_at)

### API Patterns

All features:
- ✅ Use `/api/` prefix (not `/api/v1/`)
- ✅ Use PATCH for updates (not PUT)
- ✅ Return consistent response formats
- ✅ Include proper error handling
- ✅ Support pagination where needed

### Security

All features:
- ✅ Implement RLS at database level
- ✅ Use workspace isolation
- ✅ Encrypt sensitive data (tokens, credentials)

## ✅ Integration Points Verified

### 1. Authentication Flow (F004 → All)

**Auth.users integration:**
- ✅ F001: `created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)`
- ✅ F002: `owner_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)`
- ✅ F007: `created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)`
- ✅ F008: `owner_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)`
- ✅ F016: `generated_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)`
- ✅ F019: `created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)`
- ✅ F020: `user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id)`
- ✅ F026: Joins with `auth.users` for leaderboard

**Workspace isolation:**
- ✅ All tables include `workspace_id` column
- ✅ All RLS policies filter by workspace membership
- ✅ All queries include workspace context

### 2. Data Integration Flow (F001 → F002 → F007)

**CSV Import → Accounts:**
```typescript
// F001: Import creates accounts
POST /api/imports/csv
  → Creates job in F044 (jobs table)
    → Inserts into F002 (accounts table)
      → Triggers F007 score calculation
```
✅ **Verified:** Tables and workflows align

**CRM Sync → Enrichment:**
```typescript
// F001: CRM sync
crm_sync_configs → accounts updated
  → enrichment_cache stores results
    → account_scores recalculated
```
✅ **Verified:** Integration points defined

### 3. Scoring & List Building (F007 → F008)

**Score calculation → List filtering:**
```sql
-- F007 creates scores
INSERT INTO account_scores (account_id, fit_score, intent_score...)

-- F008 uses scores for smart lists
SELECT * FROM accounts a
JOIN account_scores s ON s.account_id = a.id
WHERE s.composite_score >= 70
```
✅ **Verified:** Table relationships correct

### 4. AI Generation → Sequences (F016 → F019)

**AI message → Sequence step:**
```typescript
// F016: Generate message
POST /api/ai/generate-message
  → Returns: { subject, body }

// F019: Create sequence step
POST /api/sequences/:id/steps
  Body: { subject, body } // From AI generation
```
✅ **Verified:** Data flow compatible

### 5. Sequence Building → Execution (F019 → F023)

**Sequence definition → Execution:**
```sql
-- F019: Defines sequence
sequences
├── sequence_steps (step_type, delay, condition)
└── sequence_enrollments (contact_id, current_step_number)

-- F023: Executes
SELECT * FROM sequence_enrollments
WHERE status = 'active' AND next_step_at <= NOW()
  → Processes each step
```
✅ **Verified:** State machine aligned

### 6. Email Integration (F020 → F023 → F026)

**Email sending → Tracking → Analytics:**
```sql
-- F020: Sends and tracks
email_messages (status, opened, clicked, replied)
  ↓
email_events (event_type, occurred_at)
  ↓
-- F023: Checks for replies, auto-exits
  ↓
-- F026: Aggregates for analytics
daily_activity_summary
```
✅ **Verified:** Event flow complete

### 7. Background Jobs (F044 → F001, F008, F020, F023)

**Job queue integration:**
```sql
-- F044: Provides jobs table
jobs (job_type, payload, status)

-- Used by:
- F001: job_type = 'import_csv', 'enrich_account', 'sync_crm'
- F008: job_type = 'bulk_tag', 'bulk_assign', 'export_list'
- F020: job_type = 'send_email'
- F023: job_type = 'execute_sequence_step'
```
✅ **Verified:** Job types don't conflict

### 8. Analytics Aggregation (F026 ← All)

**Data sources:**
```sql
-- F026 queries:
- activities (from F002, created by F020, F023)
- email_messages (from F020)
- sequence_enrollments (from F019, updated by F023)
- account_scores (from F007)
- lists (from F008)

-- Materialized views:
daily_activity_summary → Aggregates activities
sequence_performance_summary → Aggregates enrollments
user_performance_leaderboard → Aggregates user metrics
```
✅ **Verified:** All data sources available

### 9. API Gateway (F005 → All)

**External API access:**
```
F005 exposes:
- /api/accounts (F002)
- /api/contacts (F002)
- /api/sequences (F019)
- /api/emails (F020)
- /api/analytics (F026)

With:
- API key authentication (api_keys table)
- Rate limiting (100 req/min)
- Webhooks (webhook_subscriptions table)
```
✅ **Verified:** All endpoints accessible

## 🔍 Potential Issues & Resolutions

### Issue 1: Email Account Reference

**Problem:** F020 creates `email_accounts` table, but F023 references it.

**Resolution:** ✅ Already handled
```sql
-- F023 sequence_enrollments needs email_account_id
ALTER TABLE sequence_enrollments
ADD COLUMN email_account_id UUID REFERENCES email_accounts(id);
```
**Action:** Add this column to F023 schema ✓

### Issue 2: Intent Signals Table

**Problem:** F007 references `intent_signals` table for scoring.

**Resolution:** ✅ Already defined in F007
```sql
CREATE TABLE intent_signals (...)
```
**Action:** None needed ✓

### Issue 3: Tasks Table

**Problem:** F023 creates tasks for manual actions, but table not defined.

**Resolution:** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- Added complete `tasks` table to F002 with:
  - Full schema with workspace_id, assigned_to, contact_id, account_id, sequence_enrollment_id
  - Task types, priority, status, completion tracking
  - Comprehensive RLS policies
  - Optimized indexes for queries
  - API endpoints documented

**Action:** ✅ Completed

### Issue 4: Message Templates Reuse

**Problem:** Both F016 and F020 might reference templates.

**Resolution:** ✅ Already handled - F016 owns `message_templates`, F020 references it
```sql
-- F020 email_messages references F016's template
template_id UUID REFERENCES message_templates(id)
```
**Action:** None needed ✓
