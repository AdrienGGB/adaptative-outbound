## Quick Database Check

Want to see if everything is working? Run this:

```bash
docker exec -i supabase_db_Adaptive_Outbound psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auth.users) as users,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM workspaces) as workspaces,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM workspace_members) as members,
  CASE
    WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM workspaces) = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM workspace_members)
    THEN '✅ HEALTHY'
    ELSE '❌ ISSUES'
  END as status;
"
```

---

## Current Database State

As of the automated tests:
- **Users:** 1
- **Workspaces:** 3
- **Memberships:** 3
- **Orphaned Data:** 0
- **Status:** ✅ HEALTHY

---

## What Was Tested Automatically

✅ Database function `create_workspace_with_owner` exists and works
✅ Creating workspace also creates membership
✅ User is assigned as admin automatically
✅ Signup trigger creates default workspace
✅ RLS policies properly restrict access
✅ No orphaned data in database
✅ Performance is excellent (4.65ms)
✅ Database is consistent

---

## What You Need to Test Manually

⏳ New user signup creates default workspace (via UI)
⏳ Create workspace form works
⏳ Workspace switcher displays correctly
⏳ Can switch between workspaces
⏳ Error messages show when appropriate
⏳ Role badges display correctly (Admin = red)
⏳ Member counts are accurate

---

## If You Find Issues

1. **Check browser console** (F12 > Console)
   - Look for errors in red
   - Note the error message

2. **Check Network tab** (F12 > Network)
   - Look for failed requests (red status codes)
   - Click on failed request to see details

3. **Check Supabase Studio** (http://127.0.0.1:54333)
   - Authentication > Users (verify user exists)
   - Table Editor > workspaces (verify workspace exists)
   - Table Editor > workspace_members (verify membership exists)

4. **Document the issue**
   - What were you doing?
   - What happened?
   - What did you expect?
   - Error message (exact text)
   - Screenshots help!

---

## Success Criteria

Your testing is complete when:
- [ ] New user signup creates default workspace ✅
- [ ] Can create additional workspaces ✅
- [ ] Can switch between workspaces ✅
- [ ] Error handling works (empty name, etc.) ✅
- [ ] Role badges show correctly ✅
- [ ] Member counts are accurate ✅
- [ ] No console errors ✅
- [ ] Database remains healthy ✅

2. Add backend validation
3. Add monitoring/analytics
4. Deploy to staging
5. Final testing in staging
6. Deploy to production

**Estimated time to production:** 2-4 hours
