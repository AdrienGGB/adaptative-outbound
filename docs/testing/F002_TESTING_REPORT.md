## 🐛 Bugs Found

### Bug #1: Dialog State Lost on Window Focus Change
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** User Experience

**Description:**
- Dialogs for contact/activity/task creation lose their content when user switches to another program/window
- Form data is cleared/reset when returning to browser

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open "Create Contact" or "Log Activity" dialog
2. Start typing in form fields
3. Switch to another application (Cmd+Tab)
4. Return to browser
5. Form content is lost

**Expected:** Form data should persist while dialog is open

**Suggested Fix:** Review dialog state management and React controlled component lifecycle

---

### Bug #2: Missing Navigation to Tasks Page
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Usability

**Description:**
- No visible button or navigation link to access the tasks page
- User had to manually navigate to `/tasks` URL

**Expected:** Tasks link should be in main navigation menu

**Suggested Fix:** Add "Tasks" link to navigation bar/sidebar

---

### Bug #3: Controlled/Uncontrolled Input Warning
**Severity:** Low
**Impact:** Console warnings (no user-facing issue)

**Description:**
- React warning about controlled/uncontrolled input state changes
- Occurs in task creation form
- Two variants of the error:
  - "changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled" (undefined → defined)
  - "changing a controlled input to be uncontrolled" (defined → undefined)

**Location:** `CreateTaskDialog` component

**Error Message:**
```
A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled.
This is likely caused by the value changing from undefined to a defined value
```

**Root Cause:** Form field values likely not initialized with empty strings (`""`) in defaultValues

**Suggested Fix:**
```typescript
// In create-task-dialog.tsx or task form
const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: {
    title: "",           // ← Ensure empty string, not undefined
    description: "",     // ← Ensure empty string, not undefined
    // ... all fields should have explicit defaults
  }
})
```
